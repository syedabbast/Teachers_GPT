About App
App Name: American Elementary School Curriculum Generator
App Function: App generates elementary grade level curriculum through pre-engineered langchain prompts template. all end users(teachers) have to do is to select their teaching grade level and curriculum will be generated. The additional function is to download the curriculum as csv file, 
App Link: Link https://teachersgpt-chatgpt.streamlit.app/
GitHub Link: https://github.com/syedabbast/Teachers_GPT
Solution: The dropdown technique not to give open text to end users and control the results by engineering prompts. 
Note:I will be using this app to teach my students . I could see this app as a potential use case in the educational industry. 
Enterprise Usage: As I am Technology Architect I believe these three libraries can build prompt engineering solutions faster, the one I have created does not demonstrate any database on the backend which would be my next step to use snowflakes database to showcase in-house promt generating results. 

I also believe this is a good candidate for the LLM Hackathon, I will just have to add a secret key to be a participant, which I am looking forward to.
